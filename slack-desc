lash: LASH (LASH Audio Session Handler)
lash:
lash: LASH is a session management system for JACK and ALSA audio apps
lash: on GNU/Linux.  It is an implementation of a proposal that originated
lash: from this discussion.  Its aim is to allow you to have many different
lash: audio programs running at once, to save their setup, close them down
lash: and then easily reload the setup at some other time.  LASH doesn't
lash: deal with any kind of audio data itself;  it just runs programs,
lash: deals with saving/loading (arbitrary) data and connects different
lash: kinds of virtual audio ports together (currently JACK and ALSA
lash: sequencer ports).  It can also be used to move entire sessions between
lash: computers, or post sessions on the Internet for download.
